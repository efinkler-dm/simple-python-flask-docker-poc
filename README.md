# A simple docker dev env example

## How to

1. Install [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. Clone this repo.
2. Open a terminal and `cd` to the root of this project repo.
3. Run `docker compose up`.
4. Visit http://localhost:5005 in your browser. You should get back a JSON response of current config settings in the PostgreSQL DB, pulled live.

Now you have a very minimal, but working Python/Flask and PostgreSQL environment.
